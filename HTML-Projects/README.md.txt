# HTML Portfolio Project

This folder contains my personal HTML portfolio project, completed as part of Section 4.3 of the Fullstack Web Developer course.

## Project Overview

The portfolio webpage showcases my early web development projects using only HTML. It includes:

- **Portfolio Homepage:** Lists my name and a brief introduction.
- **Links to Projects:**  
  - [Movie Ranking Project](./public/movie-ranking.html) with a preview image  
  - [Birthday Invite Project](./public/birthday-invite.html) with a preview image
- **Navigation:**  
  - [About Me](./public/about.html)  
  - [Contact Me](./public/contact.html)

## Structure

- All project HTML files are organized in the `public` folder.
- Preview images for each project are stored in the `assets/images` folder.
- The main `index.html` file links to each project and displays preview images.

## How This Was Built

- Followed course instructions and TODOs to build the portfolio step by step.
- Used semantic HTML structure, links, and images for project previews.
- Organized files and folders for clarity and scalability.

## TODOs Completed

- Created HTML boilerplate and structured the portfolio homepage.
- Added previous projects' HTML files to the `public` folder.
- Took screenshots of project previews and added them to the `assets/images` folder.
- Linked project pages and included preview images.
- Added navigation links for "About Me" and "Contact Me" pages.
